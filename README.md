To run the application, we need node.js (install it via their website).

For better confort during development, install gulp with some commands.
Right click in the project folder while holding shift and open a terminal.

To begin, install gulp.
``` 
npm install gulp
```

Then install browser-sync.
```
npm install browser-sync
```
Finally, start the application with gulp (gulpfile.js for more details).

```
gulp serve
```
